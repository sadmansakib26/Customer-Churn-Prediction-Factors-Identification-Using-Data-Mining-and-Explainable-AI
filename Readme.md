This repository includes the code for my undergraduate Capstone Project titled "Customer Churn Prediction & Factors Identification Using Data Mining and Explainable AI." The Script folder contains the main code, while the Data & Outputs folder stores both the processed and original datasets, and outputs. Additionally, the Additional Code folder contains code for SHAP and Clustering (unorganized, I will update it in the Scripts folder Insha Allah).
